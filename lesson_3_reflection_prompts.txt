When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    There may be a case where you want a file that would only make sense on the remote repo so you would create it there rather 
    than locally where it wouldn't make sense i.e. instructions that are specific to the remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Depending on the feature or perhaps fix that is being done, you may not want to move past a certain logical
    point in time for the product so manually pulling would be better as it allows a better degree of control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones of remote repositories that are generally used if you don't have permission on a remote repository.
    Clones are copies of repositories local or remote
    Branches are within the same repository and cause a divergence for a piece of work, usually a new feature or bug fix.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It could make compares easier. Also merges can be sorted out without corrupting the remote.
